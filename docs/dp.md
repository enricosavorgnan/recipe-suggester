## 2. Project Summary

### 2.1 Scope
1. Use Case: 			I have a full fridge and any idea about what to cook!
2. Data Sources: 	
	- For train&test: 	Dataset TBD - e.g. FoodSeg103, FoodSeg154
	- For usecase: 		Images by user, cropped to a finite size
3. Requirements:	
	- Non-functional	
		- The system should be able to correct recognize and classify food in an image	
		- The system should be able to interact with an LLM to generate receipes
		- The system should be able to support contemporaneous accesses once deployed
	- Functional
4. Constraints:
	- Bo
	

### 2.2 Objectives
1. Include predictions for 100 classes of food
2. Reach 95% correct and complete predictions
3. Reach 90% user satisfaction in two months

### 2.3 Relevance
For users: 	Free ideas for cooking meals
